# Restaurant-Recommendation-System
The task is to generate a top-n list of restaurants according to the consumer preferences. We can simply say that Recommendation engines are nothing but just an automated form of a person who is sitting at shop counter and predict about customer on the basis of their previous experience or customer choice. If customer ask him for a product then he not only to show that product, but also the related ones which you could buy. They are well trained in cross selling and up selling. So, does our recommendation engines. The ability of these engines to recommend personalized content, based on past behavior is incredible. It brings customer delight and gives them a reason to keep returning to the website.
